        An ISP is a company that gives you access to the Internet. You sign up for an account with an ISP
        just as you do for telephone service or utilities. ISPs are usually phone companies
        (for a DSL or fiber optic connection) or TV providers (for a cable or satellite connection).</p>
    <p>Hardware. For a broadband connection, such as DSL, fiber optic, or cable, you'll need a broadband modem.
        This might be included as part of the start-up hardware from your ISP when you sign up for a broadband account.
        If you plan to share Internet access with multiple PCs by using a home network, you'll also need a router."</p>
